# ASDM Specs Repository

This directory contains general specifications (rules) for various technology stacks and development practices. These specs are automatically added by `asdm-bootstrapper` as needed.

## Overview

Specs in this directory provide:
- Coding standards and best practices
- Performance guidelines
- Testing strategies
- Architecture recommendations

## Adding New Specs

To add a new technology spec:

1. Create a new directory under `specs/`
2. Add README.md with overview and index
3. Add relevant specification documents
4. Update `specs-registry.json` with new entry

Example structure:
```
specs/
├── {tech-name}/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── {tech-name}-coding-standard.md
│   ├── {tech-name}-performance-guidelines.md
│   └── {tech-name}-testing-guidelines.md
```

## Registry

The `specs-registry.json` file tracks all available specs and is used by the Admin UI to display spec details.

## Usage

AI agents automatically receive relevant specs based on the technology stack detected in the workspace. These specs help maintain consistent code quality and follow best practices.

## Integration

Specs integrate with:
- `asdm-bootstrapper`: Automatically adds specs to workspaces
- AI coding assistants: Provides context and guidelines
- Admin UI: Displays spec information and details

## Support
